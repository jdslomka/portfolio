Hey there! This is my first article, and I’m thrilled to share a bit about myself. I’m a Full Stack Software Developer who finds inspiration in both coding and beekeeping, driven by a curiosity that ties these worlds together.

I’m John, and I’ve always been fascinated by how things work—whether it’s a line of code or the intricate dance of a beehive. Let’s explore how my curiosity shapes my journey in software development and beekeeping.

## A Curious Coder

I’m a developer based in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, CA, where I build applications that bring ideas to life. My curiosity drives me to explore new technologies and solve problems in creative ways. I’m always tinkering, learning, and asking “what if?”—whether I’m designing a user-friendly interface or diving into a new framework. It’s this sense of wonder that keeps me passionate about creating software that makes a difference.

## Curiosity in the Hive

Beekeeping? It might seem like an unusual hobby, but it’s a perfect reflection of my curious nature. I’m captivated by new ideas and dreams that leave a lasting impression on me. One of those dreams is to own and care for my own bees—a goal I’m working toward with the same enthusiasm I bring to coding. Beekeeping and software development share surprising similarities: both require patience, a willingness to experiment, and the humility to learn from mistakes. Whether I’m nurturing a hive or debugging an app, my curiosity pushes me to keep exploring and growing.

### What Beekeeping Teaches Me

1. **Experimentation**: Trying new approaches with bees is like testing solutions in code.
2. **Patience**: Both bees and software projects teach me to take my time and get it right.
3. **Curiosity**: Every hive and every project sparks new questions to explore.

Through coding and beekeeping, my curiosity keeps me dreaming and building—whether it’s a new app or a future beehive.
